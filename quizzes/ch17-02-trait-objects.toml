Unlike some OOP languages, a trait object cannot be "downcasted" to a more concrete type
(except in the case of the [`Any`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/index.html) trait).

Consider implementing a generic function in two ways:

```
fn f_opt1<T: SomeTrait>(t: &T) { /* ... */ }
fn f_opt2(t: &dyn SomeTrait) { /* ... */ }
```

Which of the following are valid reasons to prefer the trait object version (`f_opt2`) over the type-parametric version (`f_opt1`)?

By avoiding monomorphization, trait-object functions will be both faster to compile and produce smaller binaries. However, this usually
comes at the cost of performance, and isn't necessarily easier for developers to work with.
