Although `n` is marked as `mut`, the reference to `n` must also be marked as `mut`. So a valid version of this program would say `incr(&mut n)`.

It is illegal to use a mutable reference to a value (`s3`) while an immutable reference 
is live (`s2`). The last line of the error is the `println` on line 6, because if you
