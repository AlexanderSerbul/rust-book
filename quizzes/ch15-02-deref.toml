The `AccessLogger` will print "deref" every time `n` is dereferenced, which occurs twice.
Note that copying `n` to `n2` does not dereference `n`.

Consider the use of deref coercions in the expression `b.len()`:

```
let s = &mut String::new();
let b = &Box::new(s);
b.len()

Which of the following is the fully expanded expression that is passed to `str::len(..)`?

First, the outer reference is dereferenced creating `(*b)`. Then the `Box` is dereferenced creating `(*b).deref()`.
Then the type `&mut String` is converted to `&str` by adding `&` and `[..]`, creating `&(*b).deref()[..]`.
